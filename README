PopWords

This little hobby project came about because I wanted to see if certain words appeared in pop music lyrics more often than others.

I used (learned) Python to acquire the songs from Billboard's API. The lyrics were a bit more challenging since the content needed to be cleaned, which resulted in some of the horribly hacky code in data.py.
The frequency tables were stored in Amazon's SimpleDB and pulled into the UI using PHP.

The frontend was done using JavaScript and the protovis visualization library.

Note: The frequency tables are cached in Amazon SimpleDB beforehand so that I don't have to call the 2 APIs everytime. (Also to prevent API changes from breaking the visualization)
